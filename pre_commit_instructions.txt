PRE-COMMIT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY)

VERIFY ARCHITECTURE: If you moved logic, check ARCHITECTURE.md. Did you violate a boundary?
RUN TESTS: Execute python3 -m unittest discover tests.
If tests failed BEFORE you started, report this.
If tests fail AFTER your changes, you MUST fix them.
CHECK CONFIG: If you added a config option, is it in config.ini.template?
CHECK VERSION: Did you update version in torrent_mover/torrent_mover.py AND README.md?
DRY RUN: Run python3 -m torrent_mover.torrent_mover --dry-run to ensure no syntax errors or immediate crashes.
