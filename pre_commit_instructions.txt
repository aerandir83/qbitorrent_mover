PRE-COMMIT INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY)
1. VERIFY ARCHITECTURE: If you moved logic, check ARCHITECTURE.md. Did you violate a boundary?
2. RUN TESTS: Execute `python3 -m unittest discover tests`. 
   - If tests failed BEFORE you started, report this. 
   - If tests fail AFTER your changes, you MUST fix them.
3. CHECK CONFIG: If you added a config option, is it in `config.ini.template`?
4. CHECK VERSION: Did you update __version__ in `torrent_mover/torrent_mover.py` AND `README.md`?
5. DRY RUN: Run `python3 -m torrent_mover.torrent_mover --dry-run` to ensure no syntax errors or immediate crashes.
