    """Creates a decorator that retries a function call.

    This decorator will re-invoke the decorated function upon exceptions up to
    a specified number of times, with an optional exponential backoff.

    Args:
        tries: The maximum number of attempts.
        delay: The initial delay between retries in seconds.
        backoff: The factor by which the delay should be multiplied after each
            failed attempt. A value of 1 results in a fixed delay.

    Returns:
        A decorator that can be applied to a function.
