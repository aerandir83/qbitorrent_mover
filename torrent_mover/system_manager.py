    """Deletes content from the destination path.

    This function handles the deletion of files or directories at the destination,
    adapting the deletion method based on the transfer mode.
    -   For remote destinations (`sftp_upload`), it uses SSH `rm -rf` for
        directories and SFTP `remove` for files.
    -   For local destinations (`sftp`, `rsync`), it uses `shutil.rmtree` for
        directories and `Path.unlink` for files.

    Args:
        dest_content_path: The absolute path to the content to be deleted.
        transfer_mode: The current transfer mode (e.g., 'sftp_upload').
        ssh_connection_pools: A dictionary of SSH connection pools, required for
            remote deletion.
